# Exercise 001

This set of C# challenges introduce exercises for working with the C# syntax.

It includes:

* Methods, variable definitions and data types
* Conditionals
* Looping
* Initial review of C# objects

In the [Exercise001Test.cs](../TechReturnersExercises.Tests/Exercise001Test.cs) file you'll find the tests - work through each test and implement the corresponding function within the [Exercise001.cs](../TechReturnersExercises/Exercise001.cs) file.

Don't forget to restore dependencies by running:

```
dotnet restore
```

You can run your tests by running the following command:

```
dotnet test
```

Work through each test 1 by 1 until you have them all passing. Initially, you'll have a lot of failing tests and a lot of output on the console. To focus on a single test, you can run specific tests such as:

```
dotnet test --filter Exercise001
```

Or to run a single test within a test file you can run dotnet test --filter FunctionName like so:

```
dotnet test --filter CapitalizeWord
```

Happy coding!
